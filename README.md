# Zindi Africa_hackathon
This is a private hackathon open to Data Science Nigeria (DSN) Pre-Bootcamp hackathon participants. This repo contains my codes and datasets submitted to the competition. I sure had fun doing this.

Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.

This solution will help Expresso to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.
